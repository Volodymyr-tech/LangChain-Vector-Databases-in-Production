# LangChain Vector Databases in Production

A collection of simple examples for working with Vector Databases using LangChain. 

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Load and process documents (PDF, etc.).
- Split text into optimized chunks.
- Generate embeddings and store them in Vector DBs.
- Perform similarity search and build RAG chains.
